         <p>Dustin Poirier has been favored by many people at UFC 269 with many not yet sold on Charles Oliveira as champion. The Brazilian won the belt at UFC 262 by TKO in the second round after overcoming adversity in the first round. Hence, Raamis' pick is Dustin by TKO.</p>

         <p>The betting odds have Pena as a significant underdog to unseat the champ, but she’s used to that status. She can understand why everyone downplays her and gives Nunes the benefit of the doubt. In the cage, she aims to change that. And if Nunes can’t show up in December, Pena said, the UFC should strip her of the bantamweight title and move on.</p>

         <p>Looking at the stylistic matchup between the two, the outcome of this bout will come down to the game plan. Both fighters have a similar style of fighting with excellent stand-up and footwork. Cody certainly has the speed and power advantage in the exchanges.</p>

         <p>Sean O’Malley last competed at July’s UFC 264 event where he scored a third round TKO victory over Kris Moutinho. Prior to that, ‘Suga’ was coming off a knockout win over Thomas Almeida at UFC 260. As for Raulian Paiva (21-3 MMA), the Brazilian will enter UFC 269 sporting a three-fight winning streak, his latest being a unanimous decision victory over Kyler Phillips back in July. Sean emerges victorious.</p>
